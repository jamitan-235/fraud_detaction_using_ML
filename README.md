# fraud_detaction_using_ML
This project focuses on building a robust fraud detection system to identify fraudulent transactions in financial datasets. By leveraging advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques, the system aims to address challenges such as class imbalance and accurately classify transactions as fraud or not fraud.
<br>
Project Overview
Goal: Detect fraudulent transactions with high accuracy, precision, and recall.
Techniques Used:
Machine Learning Models: XGBoost, Bagging, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, GaussianNB, ComplementNB, and MLP Classifier.
Handling Imbalanced Data: Implemented SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to balance the dataset and improve minority class detection.
